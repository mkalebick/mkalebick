ğŸ‘‹ Hi! I'm Makenzie Kalebick, but I go by Kenzie.

ğŸ“š I have a Master's of Science in Data Analytics from UTSA.

ğŸ“Š I worked in marketing and advertising for three years and have worked as a Data Analyst for a little over a year. I have always loved everything data-related. I am proficient in Python, SQL, Power BI, and Tableau, and I am ready to apply what I have learned.
